# Week 4: Algorithm Enhancement and Preliminary Performance Optimization

## üìò Daily Learning Journal ‚Äì Day 1 (Technical English & Speaking)

**Introduction**

Today I immersed myself in a multi-step technical English training plan aimed at improving both my reading comprehension and spoken fluency. I focused on advanced concepts like Java 21 virtual threads and practiced structured output in English.

**Reading & Vocabulary**

I carefully read a Netflix blog post on ‚ÄúJava 21 Virtual Threads‚Äù and created detailed annotations. During this process, I learned and added 50 technical terms‚Äîsuch as *carrier thread*, *pinning*, *blank VT*, and *ReentrantLock*‚Äîto my Quizlet deck for active review and reinforcement.

**Shadowing & Pitch**

I practiced shadowing two complex sentences about thread pinning and deadlock, recording them as `shadow1-day1.wav` and `shadow2-day1.wav`. Then, I drafted and recorded a 90-second elevator pitch for the PLM project using Spring Boot and Kafka, using interactive UI prototypes and a dynamic validation engine.

**Algorithm Explanation**

For algorithm practice, I selected a Medium-level LeetCode problem involving prefix sums, and prepared a clear 3-minute English explanation. My breakdown included problem restatement, edge-case handling, a hash-map optimized solution, and analysis of time and space complexity.

**Reflection**

This structured day helped me internalize technical vocabulary through annotation and flashcards while speaking aloud forced clarity in my pronunciation and pacing. My biggest challenge was managing natural pauses and emphasizing key terms like *throughput* and *synchronized* without overthinking every word.

**Looking Ahead**

Tomorrow I plan to refine my elevator pitch delivery, tackle a more challenging LeetCode problem, and expand my glossary with 50 additional terms to deepen my technical vocabulary pool.
